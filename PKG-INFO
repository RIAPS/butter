Description: ========
         Butter
        ========
        "Making things that little bit butter under linux"
        
        Butter is a library to integrate some of Linux's low level features into python
        eg signalfd, eventfd and timerfd. most of these functions are handy if you are 
        looking into creating non-blocking servers, dealing with event loops or writing
        high performance services
        
        Features
        ---------
         * Full testing of all error conditions in unit tests
         * Small set of exceptions to deal with
         * asyncio compatible versions of calls
         * Emulation and reuse of built in objects wherever possible
         * Both low level 1:1 calls and a high level interface available
         * Default values chosen follow 'least surprise' principle (eg CLOCK_MONOTONIC
           instead of CLOCK_REALTIME to avoid issues with clock updates)
         * Single codebase supporting python 2 and python 3 without modifcation for 
           easier forward migration
        
        Whats Available
        ----------------
         * inotify (Complete support, includes asyncio support)
         * fanotify (Limited support, includes asyncio support)
         * splice
         * tee
         * vmsplice (Removed, cant be done safely with Python, use os.writev instead)
         * gethostname
         * sethostname
         * mount
         * umount
         * pivot_root
         * getpid (bypasses glibc caching)
         * getppid (bypasses glibc caching)
         * eventfd (includes asyncio support)
         * timerfd (includes asyncio support)
         * 'sloppy' timers (inaccurate timers that may experince jitter for power saving)
         * Wake timers (timers that may wake a system from suspend)
         * pthread_sigmask (Avalible in python3.x but backported for python2.7)
         * signalfd (includes asyncio support)
         * memfd
        
        Whats Coming
        -------------
        Most of these exist in v0.2 as ctypes code. these are currently being rewritten
        to use cffi for speed and compatibility with pypy
        
         * posix/linux aio (scatter/gather read writes with a completion based API 
           instead of a 'ready' based interface, eg similar to IOCP on windows)
         * Sphinx documentation
         * Example code
         * More unit tests
        
        Supported Python
        -----------------
        Butter currently supported the following python interpreters
        
        * pypy (2.7 and 3.2 python implementations)
        * cpython 3.4 (required for asyncio support)
        * cpython 3.x
        * cpython 2.7
        
        Butter may work on older versions however it has not been tested on anything 
        except the above interpreters and may break without warning
        
        Installing
        -----------
        butter makes use of several C libraries to provide low level functionality. most
        of the compilation is taken care of by setup.py and cffi at install time however 
        you will need to ensure that some header files are available on the machine doing 
        the compilation (which may be different to the machine butter is being packaged 
        for and Finally installed on)
        
        Dev packages required:
         * kernel headers for a fairly recent kernel (3.x recommended)
         * libffi-dev (required for cffi)
         
        to install butter use the following command:
        
            $ pip install setuptools 
            $ pip install butter
        
        this will pull in all the required dependencies and compile the required C 
        extensions
        
        for asyncio support, python 3.4 or newer is required. importing the asyncio 
        modules on older versions of python will throw a syntax error. Hence why these
        are namespaced under butter.asyncio rather than in the base modules
        
        Design
        -------
        The 'fd' apis have been designed first as thin wrappers around the underlying
        kernel syscalls. A File-like object that then uses these syscalls is then made 
        available that obeys the 'event like' interface and is based on the interface
        provided by File and friends. They are intended to be drop in replacements and 
        be used with the select module
        
        Event-like objects
        +++++++++++++++++++
        Event like objects are identical to filelike objects except they have the 
        following extra methods to replace the disabled read/readline/write/writeline
        functionality
        
         * read_event:  Return a single event
         * read_events: Return all cached events OR read all events from the kernel
        
        AsyncIO
        ++++++++
        Some syscalls (ones that deal with fd's) have been made to work with the 
        asyncio framework that became avalible in python3.4. The asyncio enabled
        object is named after the normal Event-like object equivlent with '_async'
        after it, eg Inotify => Inotify_async. These asyncio Eventlike objects are
        designed to act and behave like the asyncio.Queue object without the ability
        to write events to the queue (ie they can only be read from and events are
        injected from the fd as required)
        
        
        Exceptions
        +++++++++++
        Butter was designed to have a small set of easily catchable exceptions and to 
        reuse the builtin exceptions wherever possible. The list below is a rough
        guide of what exceptions you can expect to receive
        
         * OSError/MemoryError: The Operating system was unable to fulfill your request
         * ValueError: One of the arguments is invalid
         * PermissionError: You do not have sufficient Privileges to use this call
         * InternalError: The function hit an internal bug that was never expected to
           be hit but is tested for just in case. Please consider filing a bug report
         * UnknownError: The Error is not specifically handled and unexpected, see 
           exception.errno for the Error code that generated this exception

        0.11 (2015-05-02)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Make close on exec the default behavior for python 3 platforms
        - Low level functions now accept a file-like or event-like object in addition to a fd
        - New 'watch' function as a simple wrapper around inotify for ultra simple uses cases
        - wait() on eventlike objects now accept a timeout value in seconds to specify the maximum ammount of
          time to wait for an event to occur
        
        **API Changes**

        - Deprecated TimerStruct (will print a DeprecationWarning if such warnings have been turned on)
        - OSError now returned instead of IOError. on python3 IOError = OSError so identical behavior will be observed
        - Identical Error codes now return Identical Exceptions, except where there is a clear reason not o (eg InternalError)
        - Errors due to incorrect arguments now all raise ValueError instead of ValueError or OSError
        
        **Bug Fixes**
        
        - C code now gets compiled at installation rather than first use
        - Fixed up the name of an exception in error handling code leading to double exception
